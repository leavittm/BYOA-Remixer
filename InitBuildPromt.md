We are building a content remixing tool
At a high level, this will take in a text prompt and a source text.
It will then use AI to generate a remix of the source text. With different parameters.
The output will be visible in the UI, with options of where to send it next.

This will be a web app, built with React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Vercel.
Please use best practices for setting up the project, with a focus on readability and maintainability.
It will be modular, with a focus on reusability and a separation of concerns.
It will be written mostly with AI, but please include comments to explain the code.
